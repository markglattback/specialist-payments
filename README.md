## Technologies

This project was built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and takes advantage of their automatic static optimisations to deliver statically generated content, and serverless functions to power contact forms on the site.

Styling is achieved through a mix of global css and [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) for scoped CSS.

Email is delivered using [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/).

Illustrations and iconography on the site are a mix of custom illustrations created by myself, and open-source illustrations from [UnDraw](https://undraw.co/).
